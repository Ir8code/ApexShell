# Apex Shell Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-15

- Created the independent Apex Shell repository from the proven standalone app.
- Shipped built-in Viewer and Terminal dock tabs.
- Kept AI seats, PTY terminals, trackers, themes, backgrounds, and drop-in extensions.
- Removed all persona, pipeline-worker, lab-specific, credential, transcript, and operator-state coupling.
- Added the agent-led install contract and Windows launcher.
- Published the public GitHub repository at `Ir8code/ApexShell` while retaining
  the private Vault remote as the build machine's canonical upstream.
- Fixed web links being misread as Windows paths at the `s:/` inside `https://`;
  HTTP(S) targets are now fully visible, clickable, keyboard-accessible, and
  opened externally only after explicit user activation.
